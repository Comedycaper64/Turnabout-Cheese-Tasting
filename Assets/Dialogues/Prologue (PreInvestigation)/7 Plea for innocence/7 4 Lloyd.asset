  - "(How dare..) \u201CAhem.. We have established that Niberboog\u2026 passed away
    after having consumed a piece of cheese, likely poisoned, from that corner of
    the room, correct?\u201D"
  - "\u201CFurthermore, we have agreed that the piece of cheese was not present until
    after the blackout, due to it being hard to miss.\u201D"
  - "\u201CThis means that unless Niberboog committed suicide in front of us, which
    I highly doubt, somebody either placed or threw the cheese there during the blackout.\u201D\r\n"
